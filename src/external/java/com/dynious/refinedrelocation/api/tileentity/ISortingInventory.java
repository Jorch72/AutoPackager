/**
 * This extends the {@link ISortingMember} interface.

 * and their inventory will actively be used in the network.
 * The Filter set in the IFilterTile interface will be used as the filter.
 *
 * Make sure you call all required methods of {@link ISortingMember} as well as
 * setInventorySlotContents(...) when this is called in your tile.
 *
 * To open the Filtering GUI for this TileEntity also implement {@link IFilterTileGUI}).
 *
 * THIS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY SYNC THE INVENTORY WITH THE CLIENT!
 *
 * To sync the inventory follow these steps:
 * Make sure you call addCrafter(...) when a player opens the container of this
 * tile (in constructor of {@link net.minecraft.inventory.Container})
 * and removeCrafter(...) when a container is closed (onContainerClosed(...) in {@link net.minecraft.inventory.Container}).
 * You also need to override putStackInSlot(...) in the container of your TileEntity and call putStackInSlot(...).
